## :closed_book: Data Cleaning Tasks
The Processes involved in the data cleaning are listed below; the data was cleaned using SQL:

 - Task 1: Correct years for given data set  
 - Task 2: removal of duplicate rows and duplicate columns
 - Task 3: fix a few labels in the given data set 
 - Task 4: encoding data into suitable format
